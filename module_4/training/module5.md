#  Machine Learning Classification Algorithms

## 1. What will you learn from this module?

1. Basic Concept in Machine Learning
2. Introduction to unsupervised and Supervised Classification
3. Accuracy Assessment in Google Earth Engine (GEE)




## 2. Course overview

Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. Machine learning methods or algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised. The two primary machine learning algorithms for supervised image processing are:
-   Random forest (RF)




This course will introduce you to the basics concept to Machine Learning algorithm in Google Earth Engine, processing supervised  classification and determining  the accuracy of classified images in the Google Earth Environment 






**After this module you'll be able to:**

- Process supervised classification in GEE 
- Apply accuracy assessment algorithm on Classification images
